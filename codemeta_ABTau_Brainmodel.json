  "description": "This software implements a whole-brain dynamic model to simulate the effects of amyloid-beta and tau protein accumulation on the excitation-inhibition balance in Alzheimerâ€™s disease. By fitting the model to regional pathology data, it captures large-scale neuronal dynamics across disease stages, revealing a shift from amyloid-beta dominance in early stages (MCI) to tau dominance in later stages (AD). The tool enables in silico exploration of protein-specific impacts on brain function and supports research into biomarker discovery and potential therapeutic targets.",
